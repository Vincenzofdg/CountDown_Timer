# CountDown Timer

On this project I intended to create a simple countdown timer to help on daily tasks by managing time and keeping users aware of time speeding.
Since it's a simple application, there was no reason for using any framework.

## Knowledges:
- DOM and Selector;
- Working with Elements;
- Events;

## Additional packages:
- [Native CountDown Component](https://github.com/talalmajali/react-native-countdown-component)
- [React Native Sound](https://github.com/zmxv/react-native-sound)
- [React Native Restart](https://github.com/avishayil/react-native-restart)
